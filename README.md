## 📘 About LIU

LIU is a symbolic language that uses emojis combined with logical operators
to create structured meaning.

Unlike casual emoji usage, LIU defines:

- grammar rules
- semantic modifiers
- compositional logic

The goal is to create a **universal intuitive language** readable across cultures.

---

## ⚙️ How LIU Works

Each emoji has a **general meaning**, not just its visual meaning.

Example:

- ☀️ → day  
- *☀️ → star  
- *☀️🌎 → Sun  

Meaning is expanded using operators and combinations.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 1. Semantic Modifiers

- `*` → object / noun  
- `#` → quality / adjective  
- `!` → action / verb  

Example:

- ❤️ → love  
- *❤️ → heart  
- !❤️! → to love  
- #❤️ → loving  

---

### 2. Emoji Combination

Meaning is built by combining symbols:

- 🏠 → building  
- *🏠 → house  
- 🏠🙂 → personal residence  
- 🧍‍♂️*🏠 → resident  

---

### 3. Key Symbols

- 🙂 → I  
- 🧍‍♂️ → person  
- 🧑🏻‍🦱 → mind  
- 👶 → childhood  

---

### 4. Special Modifiers

- `@` → identity / name  
- `$` → money / value  
- `%` → function / work  

---

### 5. Structure & Logic

LIU uses operators for:

- hierarchy (`^`, `v`)
- comparison (`<`, `>`)
- time (`|`, `/`)
- grouping (`(`, `[`, `{`)

### 5.1. Hierarchy

- `^` → above
- `v` → below
- `=` → same level

Examples:

- `^🙂` → father
- `=🙂` → you
- `v🙂` → son

### 5.2. Comparison

- `<` → smaller
- `>` → larger

Examples:

- `<*🌲` → bonsai
- `>*🌲` → sequoia

### 5.3. Time

- `|` → beginning
- `/` → end

Examples:

- `|🙂` → birth
- `/🙂` → death

### 5.4. Composition and scope

- `]` → what something is made of
- `)` → more fundamental component or content
- `}` → broader concept

Examples:

- `]*🌲` → wood
- `)*🌲` → cellulose
- `}🌲` → vegetation
- `]*🏠` → brick
- `)*🏠` → mud
- `}*🏠` → residential

### 5.5. Grouping

- `(` → small group
- `[` → larger group
- `{` → supergroup

Examples:

- `(*🌲` → grove
- `[*🌲` → forest
- `(🏠` → neighborhood
- `[🏠` → city
- `{🏠` → state
- `☀️` → day
- `(☀️` → week
- `[☀️` → month
- `{☀️` → year

## 6. LIU Endings

LIU also uses endings to mark gender, number, verb tense, and possession.

### Gender and number

- `x` → neutral
- `a` → feminine
- `o` → masculine
- `:` → plural

Examples:

- `🙂x` → neutral person
- `🙂a` → woman
- `🙂o` → man
- `🙂:` → people

## 7. Possession

Possession is indicated with `&`:

- `&🙂` → my / mine
- `&🙂:` → my / mine (plural)
- `&=🙂` → your / yours
- `&=🙂x` → your / yours
- `&=🙂a` → hers
- `&=🙂o` → his

## 8. Grammatical links and interrogatives

LIU has short and regular links to build sentences.

Examples:

- `_1` → one
- `_x` → of
- `_>x` → in
- `_🙂o` → this
- `_&o` → of this
- `_>🙂o` → that
- `_🏠` → here
- `_>🏠` → there
- `_)` → with
- `_>` → for
- `_🙂?` → who
- `_🏠?` → where
- `_⏱️?` → when
- `_@?` → which
- `_$?` → how much

## 9. Use of aliases

LIU allows **aliases** between common emojis, which are not part of the list of basic emojis,
and combinations formed by two or more basic emojis.

This makes it possible to use emojis that already exist on the keyboard or mobile phone
without needing to create a new word in every language. Instead, the system treats certain
common emojis as equivalent to compositions already defined in LIU.

Examples of compositions with basic emojis:

- `👕🦶🏻` → shoe
- `👕🦶🏻a` → women’s shoe
- `🙂👕🦶🏻` → sneaker
- `%👕🦶🏻` → boot
- `*🌲` → tree
- `*🌲~🍀` → cactus

Examples of aliases:

- `👞 ↔ 👕🦶🏻`
- `👠 ↔ 👕🦶🏻a`
- `👟 ↔ 🙂👕🦶🏻`
- `🥾 ↔ %👕🦶🏻`
- `🌳 ↔ *🌲`
- `🌵 ↔ *🌲~🍀`

In the case of an alias such as `🌳 ↔ *🌲`, there is a direct one-to-one correspondence.
This is important because many emojis have very similar drawings. By defining aliases
of this kind, LIU starts treating these variations as equivalent within the system.

Since aliases relate **emoji to emoji**, this definition applies equally to
all languages. Thus, it is defined only once and can be reused throughout LIU.

In this way, the language remains organized around a reduced set of basic emojis,
without losing the practical flexibility of also using the many other existing emojis.

## 10. General remarks

The LIU database is still in a phase of creation and expansion.
At present, the most developed languages in the system are **Portuguese** and **English**,
while the others are being gradually prepared.

## 11. Objective and importance of LIU

Because it is a pictographic language, based on symbols and not on words from a single language,
LIU can be read by users of different languages in their own local translation.

For example:

- `🙂 !❤️ =🙂`

it can be read as:

- **Eu amo você** → for Portuguese speakers
- **I love you** → for English speakers
- **Ich liebe dich** → for German speakers

Thus, LIU has the potential to facilitate communication between people of different languages.

In addition, LIU can be useful in:

- initial adult literacy
- children's learning
- intuitive teaching of verb, adjective, and noun
- multilingual signage
- playful use by children and young people
- philosophical reflection on the meaning of words

For example:

- `🙂` → I
- `❤️` → love
- `=🙂` → you
- `❤️🙂a` → girlfriend
- `>❤️🙂a` → wife
- `(❤️🙂a` → family

In these cases, besides generating the desired word, LIU also makes explicit
a structure of meaning.

This kind of development would hardly be carried out by a single person without computational support.
Artificial intelligence made it possible to take this concept from paper and implement it in practice.

Anyone who wishes to help in the development of LIU, through technical collaboration,
criticism, suggestions, or revision, may contact Dr. Ulianov.

Donations are also welcome. At present, this work is being carried out for the benefit of humanity,
without sponsorship or financial support, and efforts are made to avoid invasive advertising on the site.

## 🗂️ How to Improve the LIU Language Databases

Anyone who wants to help can improve the LIU language databases.

Currently, the website www.liu777.org uses the Python program liu.py to load its databases, which currently contain emoji and text data in JSON format, such as:
- `LIUv1-pt.json`
- `TXT_LIUv1-pt.json`
- `LIUv1-ig.json`
- `TXT_LIUv1-ig.json`

These are databases in Portuguese and English created from Python programs:
-`dbliu_pt.py` → LIU database in Portuguese
-`dbliu_ig.py` → LIU database in English

For other languages, this repository contains only the basic LUI framework for each language:
- `dbliu_fr.py` → LIU database in French
- `dbliu_ru.py` → LIU database in Russian
- `dbliu_es.py` → LIU database in Spanish
- `dbliu_it.py` → LIU database in Italian
- `dbliu_jp.py` → LIU database in Japanese
- `dbliu_ch.py` → LIU database in Chinese
- `dbliu_ge.py` → LIU database in German

Each language file contains entries with 3 columns, for example:

`["❤️🙂","couple (sweethearts)","[love + me = couple] @Poli"],`

Where:

- `"❤️🙂"` → LIU symbol
- `"couple (sweethearts)"` → main word with possible synonyms
- `"[love + me = couple] @Poli"` → explanation of the symbol and authorship

### Notes for contributors
- New words should be placed close to emojis from the same semantic group
- Anyone who creates new words may include authorship, for example: `@Author_name`
- Entries marked with `@Google` or `@GPT5` can be revised and improved
- Future language files should keep the same standard naming pattern for consistency

### Grammatical keys in the third column

Some entries use grammatical keys in the third column to indicate which form
of the word should be used in each grammatical case.

The rule is:

- each expression between `()` in the **second column**
- corresponds to one grammatical key in the **third column**
- in the same order

Example in Portuguese:

`["!🙂","é (são) (sou) (és) (é) (somos) (sois) (são)","(num_plu) (1ps) (2ps) (3ps) (1pp) (2pp) (3pp) @Poli"],`

This means:

- `é` → default form
- `(são)` → plural form → `(num_plu)`
- `(sou)` → first person singular → `(1ps)`
- `(és)` → second person singular → `(2ps)`
- `(é)` → third person singular → `(3ps)`
- `(somos)` → first person plural → `(1pp)`
- `(sois)` → second person plural → `(2pp)`
- `(são)` → third person plural → `(3pp)`

Another examples:

`["!🙂:","são (somos) (sois) (são)","(1pp) (2pp) (3pp) @Poli"],`

`["!🙂v","foi (fui) (foste) (foi) (fomos) (fostes) (foram)","(1ps) (2ps) (3ps) (1pp) (2pp) (3pp) @Poli"],`

`["!🙂^","será (serei) (serás) (será) (seremos) (sereis) (serão)","(1ps) (2ps) (3ps) (1pp) (2pp) (3pp) @Poli"],`

### Meaning of the grammatical keys

- `(1ps)` → first person singular
- `(2ps)` → second person singular
- `(3ps)` → third person singular
- `(1pp)` → first person plural
- `(2pp)` → second person plural
- `(3pp)` → third person plural
- `(num_plu)` → plural form
- `{gen_fem}` → feminine gender
- `{gen_masc}` → masculine gender

### Example in English

In English, the same logic applies, but usually uses fewer conjugation forms than Portuguese.

For that reason, only the forms that are really needed should be included.

A simple example is:

`["!🙂","is (are)","(num_plu) @Poli"],`

This means:

- `is` → singular form
- `(are)` → plural form → `(num_plu)`

So, if a language does not use a certain distinction, that key should simply be omitted.
